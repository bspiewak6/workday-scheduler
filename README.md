3. When the user views the time blocks for the current day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4. When they click on the time block, they can enter an event, save the event with the button for that time block and then the text will save in local storage.
5. This daily calendar will save events so that whenever the user returns to the application, their events will be shown.
